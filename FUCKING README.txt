The character select menu currently only has BF (and all of his base game reskins), Pico, and Accelerant Hank (with Antipathy Hank as a reskin)
Be sure to add my Accelerant and Antipathy port to your game!!
if you want to add more characters to the menu you'll need to recompile sorry


The sound test has all of the original codes, plus a few extras for a few different songs if you have them (if not it will crash)
The warp zone has all of the original songs with the exception of Alone, replaced with Endless Cycles (endless-cycles) as a placeholder
